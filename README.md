# LDraw for Visual Studio Code 

![https://github.com/michaelgale/ldraw-vscode/blob/master/LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


This repository contains a language support extension to Visual Studio Code for [LDraw](https://www.ldraw.org) files.

LDraw is an open standard for LEGOÂ® CAD software.  It is based on a hierarchy of elements describing primitive shapes up to complex LEGO models and scenes. 

## Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides convenient syntax highlighting for working with LDraw files.  It recognizes all LDraw keywords and some keywords/meta-commands from other tools such as LPub and LSynth.  Lines that contain primitives (line types 1-5) have elements such as colour, coordinates, and matrix coefficients indiviually highlighted into groups for easy visual parsing.

## Installation

Copy the LDraw extension to the VSCode extension directory:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
- **macOS/Linux**: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/michaelgale/ldraw-vscode.git
    $ cp -R ldraw-vscode ~/.vscode/extensions/ldraw-vscode
```

Restart VSCode and the extension should run automatically everytime you open a file with `.ldr`, `.dat` or `.mpd` file extension.
